# Algorand Features and Smart Contracts with AlgoSigner

## Before You Begin

 - You should have access to an Algorand node (this demo assumes you're using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.purestake.io/">PureStake</a>).
 - You should have Node.js installed on your computer.
 - You should be using Google Chrome, because AlgoSigner only works on Google Chrome at this time.
 - You should have the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm">AlgoSigner Google Chrome extension</a> installed, as this demo makes extensive use of it.
 - You should also make a couple of wallets on Algorand <strong>TestNet</strong> and use the <a target="_blank" href="https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser">TestNet ALGO Faucet</a> to generate Algos for them, as these exercises demonstrate how to move assets between two or more addresses.</p>
